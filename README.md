# Log Blox

An ethereum event indexer that manages a postgres schema

# Dev startup

Startup the database:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

Note: This also starts up a hasura instance pointing to the database which can be used to create a crud interface with the indexer.

Start the indexer:

```shell
yarn
yarn dev
```
